ClÃ©ment DO ROSARIO
Student ID: 21363234


This project is the implementation I made during the spring semester 2022 for CS-4076 Event Driven Programming.

The ZorkGUI.pro and the video are in the root of the folder.
Link for the github: https://github.com/elendir41/Zork.git

For the wordle game, there txt file named wordle.txt with the list of the words in the game.
To make sure everything works perfectly the build of the project has to be in the folder and not outside.
It can be changed by going to Project -> Build and change the build directory in QT Creator.

Here the list of of what I have implemented:
	- virtual functions
	- namespaces
	- operator overloading
	- abstract class
	- copy constructors
	- pre-processor directive
	- c++ object construction sequence
	- initializer list
	- c++ references
	- pointers
	- inheritance
	- Destructors
	- header files
	- arrays and pointers
	- friendship
	- private, protected and public
